Hello! Thank you for downloading the script, I hope you like it.

Step 1 - Get the code block from the tables below depending on which one you are using, qb or esx.

Item list for QB 
    ['giftbox'] = {["name"] = "giftbox", ["label"] = "Christmas Box", ["weight"] = 100, ["type"] = "item", ["image"] = "giftbox.png", ["unique"] = false, ["useable"] = true, ["shouldClose"] = true, ["combinable"] = nil, ["description"] = nil},

Item list for ESX
	["giftbox"] = {
		label = "Christmas Box",
		weight = 1,
		stack = true,
		close = true,
	},

Step 2 - Put the giftbox picture in this folder into the section where pictures are stored in your inventory.

Step 3 - After completing the above steps, start the script with the "ensure kvl-christmas" code via server.cfg and restart your server.

Step 4 - Enjoy it!
